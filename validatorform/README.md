## Form component with versatile validators

I saw inspiration on this on reddit somewhere but couldnt find it since.
The basic idea is a react component i can drop into projects if needed
where i can customize what inputs go in and what validators to have on each
input.

## What technologies did i use?

This is a pure react component with font awesome icons.
